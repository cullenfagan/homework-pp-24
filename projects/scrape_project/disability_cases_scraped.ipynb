The lawsuit was filed in June 2023 after an investigation that found the county excluded individuals with disabilities from participating in its in-person voting programs by selecting and using vote centers with architectural barriers. The lawsuit also alleged that the county’s curbside voting program was inaccessible. Under the settlement agreement, the county will work with an independent accessibility expert for three years on site selection policies and procedures to ensure that the county selects locations to serve as voting centers that are, or can be made more accessible during the voting period. The county has agreed to work with the expert and the department to implement recommendations. The expert will provide semiannual reports on their findings to the county and the department. \n",

The department’s brief explains that, under the ADA, voters with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to vote by a particular method as do voters without disabilities, and that this equal opportunity requirement is separate from the requirement that public entities make reasonable modifications.\n",

The department identified architectural barriers at St. Louis polling places, including inaccessible parking, ramps that were too steep, stairs at the only entrance or route to the voting area, and doorways with thresholds that were too high. The department also identified that the St. Louis Board fails to provide accessible curbside voting and auxiliary aids and services, including headphones for some accessible voting machines, and also fails to provide voters with disabilities the same amount of privacy and independence while voting as voters without disabilities. Under the agreement, the St. Louis Board will begin remediating its voting program. To make its selected polling places accessible, the St. Louis Board will employ temporary measures, such as portable ramps, signage, and propped open doors. In addition, the St. Louis Board will train its poll workers and other elections staff on the requirements of the ADA and how to use temporary measures to ensure each polling place is accessible during elections. The St. Louis Board will also survey polling locations for accessibility and maintain the accessibility of each polling place it uses on election days. When selecting future polling places, the agreement requires the St. Louis Board to select locations that will be accessible during elections.\n",

The St. Louis Board will hire an expert for conducting or reviewing accessibility surveys, identifying appropriate temporary measures, and training staff. The agreement expires on July 11, 2025.\n",

            "Description: On August 1, 2024, the Department of Justice reached an agreement with Los Angeles County to resolve its lawsuit alleging that the county violated the ADA by denying voters with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in its voting programs, services, and activities when it failed to select and use facilities as polling places that are accessible to persons with disabilities. The lawsuit was filed in June 2023 after an investigation that found the county excluded individuals with disabilities from participating in its in-person voting programs by selecting and using vote centers with architectural barriers. The lawsuit also alleged that the county’s curbside voting program was inaccessible. Under the settlement agreement, the county will work with an independent accessibility expert for three years on site selection policies and procedures to ensure that the county selects locations to serve as voting centers that are, or can be made more accessible during the voting period. The county has agreed to work with the expert and the department to implement recommendations. The expert will provide semiannual reports on their findings to the county and the department. \n",

            "Description: On January 31, 2024, the Justice Department filed a statement of interest explaining how the ADA's equal opportunity and reasonable modification requirements apply in the voting context.  The statement of interest was filed in In Re Georgia SB 202, a consolidated lawsuit challenging restrictions on absentee and in-person voting under Georgia Senate Bill SB 202 (“SB 202”).  One of the private lawsuits alleges that SB 202 fails to provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to vote absentee and in-person or make reasonable modifications to avoid disability-based discrimination, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The department’s brief explains that, under the ADA, voters with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to vote by a particular method as do voters without disabilities, and that this equal opportunity requirement is separate from the requirement that public entities make reasonable modifications.\n",

            "Description: On Jan. 12, 2021, the Justice Department reached a settlement under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) with the Board of Election Commissioners for the City of St. Louis to ensure that St. Louis polling places are accessible during elections to individuals with mobility and vision impairments. The department identified architectural barriers at St. Louis polling places, including inaccessible parking, ramps that were too steep, stairs at the only entrance or route to the voting area, and doorways with thresholds that were too high. The department also identified that the St. Louis Board fails to provide accessible curbside voting and auxiliary aids and services, including headphones for some accessible voting machines, and also fails to provide voters with disabilities the same amount of privacy and independence while voting as voters without disabilities. Under the agreement, the St. Louis Board will begin remediating its voting program. To make its selected polling places accessible, the St. Louis Board will employ temporary measures, such as portable ramps, signage, and propped open doors. In addition, the St. Louis Board will train its poll workers and other elections staff on the requirements of the ADA and how to use temporary measures to ensure each polling place is accessible during elections. The St. Louis Board will also survey polling locations for accessibility and maintain the accessibility of each polling place it uses on election days. When selecting future polling places, the agreement requires the St. Louis Board to select locations that will be accessible during elections.\n",
            "On October 3, 2023, the Department and St. Louis Board agreed to modify and extend the agreement. The St. Louis Board will hire an expert for conducting or reviewing accessibility surveys, identifying appropriate temporary measures, and training staff. The agreement expires on July 11, 2025.\n",

Wisconsin Election Commission, et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-0402 clarifying the obligation to provide assistance to voters with disabilities under Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act and Title II of the ADA.  In their motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs argue that Wisconsin law violates Section 208 by barring the assistance they need to return their absentee ballots to be counted and that the ADA requires Wisconsin to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.\n",

Plaintiffs allege that Ohio law unlawfully restricts who may assist voters with disabilities with voting absentee in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, and other laws. Ohio\\u2019s law added a criminal penalty for impermissibly possessing or returning another person\\u2019s absentee ballot. The SOI confirms that Section 208 permits voters with disabilities who require assistance to receive that assistance from any person they choose, so long as that person is not an agent of the voter\\u2019s employer or union.
